# E-shop-clothing-predictive-modelling

In this project, I was tasked to do Data Exploration and perform any necessary data cleaning using R.
Exploratory data analysis methods were also used to further understand the data better and also having a rough idea on which predictor pairs are suitable for supervised learning models.

Furthermore, I've also built the KNN model using wKNN and k-fold cross validation methods to further increase the model's accuracy. 
The Hierarchical Clustering models were also built in this assignment.
